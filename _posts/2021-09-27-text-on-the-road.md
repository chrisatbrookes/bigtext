We must offer some admiration for those people who paint the text on the road. These letters (white or often yellow), are painted skilfully so as to read well from an angle. Of course, the letters need to be geometrically perfect, but some distortion helps the readablity from a moving vehicle.

## Typeface

Most often the type face used will be sans serif, but I have one example here where there is a slab serif used.

## Construction Lines

The letters don't last forever and so they do need repainting from time to time. When there is a new lettering project then chalk is used to outline the letters to guide the "painter". Using the term painter may be a misnommer since paint brushes are not involved!
