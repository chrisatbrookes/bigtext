This site is all about large text; text that is meant to be read from a distance.

A bit like the *handwriting* script on this French supermarket.

![Supermarket in Matignon France](../uploads/50235940643_ac1b24212c_k.jpg "Supermarket in Matignon France")

I am on the lookout for examples (good and bad) of the way text can be seen in the environment where the scale is often presented at sizes that might be described as big, large and gigantic.

What examples are we likely to find here:

* posters
* billboards
* buildings
* signage
* livery - transport / lorries / planes / ships

## My logo and banner image

I decided to create my logo and banner image from text and used the full space (the square in the logo and the wide) for the text. The 2 words *Big* and *Text* in contrasting colours - bright and dramatic. I have opted to use the ***deep*** setting for the banner image and not put the text in the banner since it seem unnecessary and detracts from the image. The logo itself is a simplified rendition of the word **big** and the letter **T.** I also made a square version of this for the favicon which I then built with the wonderful web site [favicon.io](favicon.io)

I put the full logo here:

And here is the image from the banner in all its glory. I'll be using this on the cover of the book that will be published from 10 of my blog posts. Watch this space!

### The name of my site / project

I decided to name my site *BigText* using CamelCase; and if you don't know what that means just look at the way the word camelcase is displayed here.

### One more thing

The image in the banner for this about page is from a photograph taken in the printmaking department at Oxford Brookes University of letterpress wood type. The image shows uppercase, lowercase and numbers in the same drawer. This type would normally be used for printing posters, such as the one that finishes this page.

![Letterpress poster from 1904 (John Heywood Ltd., Printers.; Houdini, Harry, 1874-1926.)](../uploads/1024px-challenge_to_houdini-_regent_theatre-_salford_lccn2014636909.jpg "Letterpress poster from 1904")

I have attempted to identify some of the typefaces used in the poster by looking in the early years section of the [Identify](http://www.identifont.com) web site.
