        "content"  : "We must offer some admiration for those people who paint the text on the road. These letters (white or often yellow), are painted skilfully so as to read well from an angle. Of course, the letters need to be geometrically perfect, but some distortion helps the readablity from a moving vehicle.\n\nTypeface\n\nMost often the type face used will be sans serif, but I have one example here where there is a slab serif used. I havn’t spotted this elsewhere so maybe this is just an odd unprofessional one?\n\n\n\nConstruction Lines\n\nThe letters don’t last forever and so they do need repainting from time to time. When there is a new lettering project then chalk is used to outline the letters to guide the painter. Using the term painter may be a misnommer since paint brushes are not involved!\n\n\n\nHow do they do It?\n\nFor sure they cause a bit of traffic congestion while they mark the road, but as you can see from these videos, it takes a lot of skill to do this right. We only see the final stage of applying the “paint”, but there must also be a few other stages before this; planning on paper and marking out with chalk on the ground.\n\nColour\n\nAs you can see from the following image (note the chalk marks), the letters can be yellow. BUS STOP has different colour from BUS LANE.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nNotice how the main type ‘artist’ has his hand behind his back. This certainly provides an impression of confidence.\n\nMystery Squiggles and Markings\n\nYou may occasionally see markings that are not using typeface styles but are just hand written markings.\n\n\n"

        "content"  : "Sometimes we just need to put that text in the sky! Getting the message visible across the city may mean building a structure and elevating the words as high as possible. We will need a good strong structure of course.\n\nIf your building isn’t high enough, you’ll need to create the letters in 3 dimensions and attach to a stable scaffold.\n\n\n\nTesco are fortunate, because they don’t need to construct holding mechanisms for punctuation. Not so their arch rival, Sainsbury’s. In the image below, you see some welded contraption to keep that apostrophe in place.\n\n\n\nCheck out the letter i, this also needs an appendage. Letters in the sky need a scaffold for support, and sometimes this can be quite elaborate.\n\nSigns are UP in the USA\n\nIf you have ever been fortunate enough to visit the United States, you will notice that there are very many signs elevated on scaffolding; hotels, motels and stores advertise their presence with elaborate constructions.  These signs are sometimes to be found atop the building but also separate structures have been built to hold the lettering.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Joshua Lewis on Unsplash\n\nI haven’t been able to identify the typeface used in the mini mart words, however, one interesting observation is that this is a mixed case font; notice the uppercase A and the lowercase n.\n\nType in Flight\n\nThe ultimate place to observe type in the sky is the graphic livery on aeroplanes in the clouds. Of course, the designs we see on the fuselage of these planes is dependant on the design schemes and branding of the companies that operate them. Here are some examples.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Daniel Eledut on Unsplash\n\nThe branding designed by FutureBrand uses a form of PT Sans Designed by ParaType. The name used a mixture of light and bold as in airmalta.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Fotis Christopoulos on Unsplash\n\nThe Emirates brand uses a bespoke font designed for them by their own design team. The font was designed in 2003 and the bold form can be found for download in various places on the web.  The shape of the letters seems to be a subtle nod to Arabic letterforms with their elaborate curves.\n\n\n\nNext time you make a journey by air, do take notice of the typefaces used.\n"

        "content"  : "RedLorryYellowLorryRedLorryYellowLorryRedLorryYellowLorryRedLorryYellowLorry. Try saying that very quickly and see if your tongue gets all twisted up. Yes, this post is all about lorry (truck if you are from the USA) typography.\n\nBig lorries need big type. That’s true but another thing that is also true is that companies use their own distribution transport to advertise themselves and a recent trend is to come up with a catchy slogan that goes beyond just the name of the company.\n\nWhen it comes to making full use of the space, look no further than FedEx (notice the camelcase too).\n\n\n\nThe FedEX logo used a bold form of the Futura typeface although there is a bit of manipulation of the spacing to achieve the arrow formed between the E and x. I have highlighted this in the image below.\n\n\n\nBig Lorries provide a Lot of Space\n\nThink of it as a moving billboard. The lorries we see on our motorways are often huge. We don’t want those big polluting vehicles coming into our cities and so, the distribution centres are usually somewhere out on the ring road. But a big lorry canvas is a space for the large scale typography to reach you as it flashes by at 60mph.\n\n\n\nLess is More\n\nOn the one hand, you might want to fill the space and make the message easy to read at high speeds, but then if the lorry is smaller (like for making local deliveries), then you can afford to have a bit of detailed information, such as in this ESSELUNGA vehicle seen in Florence, Italy.\n\n\n\nThe Akceler typeface can be found for purchase from various foundries but freely available. You can see here the glyphs provided in the bold form.\n\n\n\nParked Lorry - time to ponder\n\nWith local delivery lorries they are often parked up while the delivery takes place. In this case the decal designer has more scope to tell a story.\n\nThis Bidfest food delivery vehicle is being used as a canvas for a landscape collage created from food products. The typography itself (bottom left) is lost in the whole scene.\n\n\n\nLogo and Branding\n\nWe can’t always identify the fonts used in a logo, because the lettering is significantly modified or, indeed built from geometry. Take this DHL logo which appears top left on this huge yellow delivery lorry.\n\n\n\nThe letters in the logo are created to indicate a sense of movement\n\nI want to point out the DHL web site that defines their brand and how all of the design elements (including the logo) are to be used across the company. This represents a fine example of a design scheme that unifies the brand.\n\nDHL (and Deutsche Post) have created their own font called ‘Delivery’ and you can see this used all across their branding (including the byline on the lorry above). I quote from their branding guidelines:\n\n\n  Delivery was developed exclusively for DHL, Deutsche Post and Deutsche Post DHL Group. It is available for anyone involved in the design of our marketing and communications materials. While it will be automatically installed on staff computers, it is also available for download and distribution to agencies and other service providers in the download section at the end of this guide.\n\n\nI was amazed to find that you can download this font with full instructions. Thanks DHL.\n\n\n\nRed Lorry Yellow Lorry\n\nHave you noticed how so many lorries are yellow?\n\nThe Red Lorry / Yellow Lorry expression is known as a tongue twister 1\n\n\n\nContainer Text\n\n\n  \n     &amp;lt;div style=&quot; display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;&quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div style=&quot;display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;&quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div style=&quot; background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div style=&quot; background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div style=&quot;padding: 19% 0;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div style=&quot;display:block; height:50px; margin:0 auto 12px; width:50px;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div style=&quot;padding-top: 8px;&quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div style=&quot; color:#3897f0; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:550; line-height:18px;&quot;&amp;gt;View this post on Instagram&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div style=&quot;padding: 12.5% 0;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div style=&quot;display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 8px;&quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div style=&quot; background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div style=&quot; width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg)&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: auto;&quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div style=&quot; width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div style=&quot; background-color: #F4F4F4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div style=&quot; width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div style=&quot;display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;&quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div style=&quot; background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div style=&quot; background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&amp;gt;A post shared by Chris Jennings (@pagebuoy)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt; \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue-twister &amp;#8617;\n    \n  \n\n"

        "content"  : "The Hollywood sign in Santa Monica, California is a well known landmark and has an interesting history, because it was originally put up in 1923 as an advertisement for land available for building homes in an area known as Hollywoodland.\n\nThe sign has gone through lots of changes over the years starting in 1949 when the ‘land’ part was removed. Originally the sign was created from 45 feet (14 metres) high sheet metal and painted white. The letters were supported with poles and wires, but as you can see from the image in the banner on this page, this wasn’t sturdy enough to protect against the strong winds that sometimes buffet these hills. Nowadays the letters are supported by very robust structures concreted into the ground.1\n\n\n\nIn this view from above by Jonathan Gonzalez, we can see the supporting structures for the letters. We should be grateful, that there has never been an attempt to make the letters all sit at the same level; the slight unevenness of the ground is what makes the word distinctive and provides the charm.\n\n\n\nThe Hollywood Font\n\nThe 45 ft letters are formed from a heavy sans serif font with distinctive angularity instead of curves. The ‘O’ (there are 3) and the ‘D’ have angles rather than curves and this may have been a practical way to cut the letters from sheet metal at that scale.\n\nThe typeface is similar to ITC Machine designed by Ronne Bonder and Tom Carnase in 1970\n\n\n\nA company called ShyFonts have created the SF Hollywood Hills font that simulated the variable baseline as seen in the real sign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      see the History Society web site &amp;#8617;\n    \n  \n\n"

        "content"  : "IKEA stores are all over the place - not just in Sweden but all over Europe. The brand is highly visible and recognisable because of its distinctive font and colour contrast. When it comes to big text, then the IKEA logo is highly visible at a distance. This is what counts, because the IKEA stores are usually located at the edge of towns and cities, near airports, or on ‘out of town’ shopping malls.\n\nThe IKEA stores are located near to motorways and are easily spotted even if you take the wrong exit!\n\nThe logo for IKEA has changed but only subtly. There was some redesign of the logo done by the Seventy Agency and 72andSunny Amsterdam. Apart from some very slight size changes the serifs were reduced further.\n\nGraphics website Brand New has published a series of diagrams that show how simple the changes are.\n\nApparently, the result is intended to create a “bigger brand presence” within the same amount of media space.\n\n\n\nThe font used in the logo is not publicly available but you can see that it does have very subtle serifs built onto a Futura type font. The closest you might get would be ‘FuturaPress’ a free font from FontsGeek.\n\n\n\nJohan Stenebo write a book about IKEA:\n\nThe Truth About IKEA: How IKEA Built Its Global Furniture Brand Paperback – 25 Nov. 2010\n\n\n\n\n\nThe image shown above was taken in 2003 and since then the IKEA brand has changed  - subtly. You can see here that back then there were no serifs at all and the font was a heavy version of ‘Futura’. You may also notice that back then that the building was yellow and the logo was in blue. Now the store has changed colour (see below).\n\nSo, whatever you think of the IKEA logo and the flat-pack culture, you must admit that the way they display their name in yellow over a blue background, catches your attention as you zip by at 70mph!\n\nHere is another image of an anonymous store, showing those little serifs.\n\n\n"
